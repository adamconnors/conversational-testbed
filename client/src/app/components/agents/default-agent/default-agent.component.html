<div class="welcome">
  <h1>Default agent UI</h1>
  <p>Hello from {{ model }}!</p>
  <p>
    This is the default agent for general conversations. It's prompted for
    general voice-to-voice conversations but is otherwise equivalent to a
    regular chat session with {{ model }}.
    <br />
    You can explore other scenarios by selecting a different agent from the
    sidebar.
