# The Black Death, 1348-9

The Black Death reached Britain in 1348, killing about one-third of the population. Ideas about what caused the Black Death and how it could be treated tell us a lot about how people in Late Medieval England thought about illness and disease.

## Believed causes

* Religion: God sent the plague as a punishment for people's sins.

* Miasma: 'bad air' or smells caused by decaying rubbish. Four Humours: most physicians believed that disease was caused by an imbalance in the Four Humours. Outsiders: strangers or witches had caused the disease.

# Prevention

* Religious methods, such as prayer, donating to the Church and flagellation. People would punish themselves to avoid punishment from God.

* Clearing up rubbish in the streets.

* Smelling their toilets or other bad smells.

* Lighting a fire in the room, ringing bells or having birds flying around the room to keep air moving. Carrying herbs and spices to avoid breathing in 'bad air'.

* Not letting unknown people enter the town or village.

# Example Question
* If someone carried herbs and spices during the Black Death, what might they think was the source of the disease?

# Example Answer
* People carried herbs and spices to avoid breathing in 'bad air'. This would be because they thought the disease was spread by miasma.

* People used a mix of rational and supernatural methods to try to prevent or treat the Black Death.
