## What was surgery like before Lister?

An operation without anaesthetics was horrible, Patients sometimes died just from the shock of the pain. However, many more patients died from something much less dramatic - infection after the operation.

Doctors knew infection could be fatal. They had used liquids such as wine and vinegar to keep wounds clean for centuries. Paré had developed his own treatment (see page 37).

However, before Pasteur's Germ Theory, no one knew what was causing the infection, so surgeons did things that seem obviously dangerous to us today.

• They reused bandages, spreading gangrene and skin infections from patient to patient.

• They did not wash their hands before an operation.

• They did not sterilise their equipment.

• Some surgeons operated wearing old blood- and pus-stained clothes.

This was how they had done operations for years. It was what they were used to.

## What inspired Lister to look for new ways to stop infection?

Joseph Lister was one of the outstanding surgeons of the nineteenth century. He was keenly interested in science and applying it to medicine. He had researched gangrene trying to understand the way that infection spread.

Most importantly, he knew all about Pasteur's work on the Germ Theory. It was Pasteur's work that drove Lister to look for ways to kill bacteria in the wound. His solution was carbolic acid.

## Where did Lister's idea of using carbolic acid come from?

The answer is sewagel In 1864, Lister observed how carbolic acid was used to reduce the smell of sewage that was used to fertilise the land. He noted how it also destroyed the parasites that usually infect cattle feeding on such land.

Lister experimented with carbolic acid to treat people with compound fractures (where the bone breaks through the skin). Infection often developed in these open wounds. Lister applied carbolic acid to the wound and used bandages soaked in it. He found that the wounds healed and did not develop gangrene.

## What impact did Lister's work have in the short term?

▼ SOURCE 1 From Lister's record of amputations

Total amputations 1864-66 without anticeptic 35 
Died 16 
Percentage who died 45.7%

Total amputations 1867-70with anticeptic 40
Died 6
Percentage who died 15%

Lister went on to use carbolic acid when he performed amputations. It dramatically reduced deaths from infection (see Source 1). In 1867, Lister published his results, showing the value of using carbolic acid. He also worked at improving his method so that bacteria were being killed at every stage of an operation.

## Why was there opposition to antiseptics?

### It was unpleasant

Carbolic spray soaked the operating theatre. It cracked the surgeon's skin and made everything smell unpleasant.

### Pasteur's ideas spread slowly

Even some trained surgeons found it hard to accept that tiny organisms were all around, causing disease. One surgeon joked with his assistants to shut the door of the operating room 'in case one of Mr Lister's microbes flew in'.

### It slowed down operations

The new precautions caused extra work. Despite anaesthetics, surgeons still thought speed was essential - often because of the problem of bleeding.

### Lister was not a showman

Unlike Pasteur, Lister did not give impressive public displays. In fact, he appeared cold and arrogant, and he criticised other surgeons. Many surgeons regarded him as a fanatic.

### It did not always work

Some surgeons tried Lister's methods but did not achieve the same results. This was usually because they were less careful, but that did not stop them criticising Lister.

### Lister changed his techniques

He did this because he wanted to find a substance that would work as well as carbolic spray, but without the corrosion that it caused. His critics simply said he was changing his methods because they did not work.

## How was opposition overcome?

### By Lister's determination

Lister's demonstrations and teachings helped to overcome opposition. In 1869, he became Professor of Clinical Surgery at Edinburgh University. Over the next eight years, he demonstrated his methods to over 1500 medical students. In 1877, he moved to King's College Hospital, London to train young surgeons.

### With help from others

Then came a link to another great name in medical history. In 1878, Robert Koch discovered the bacterium which caused septicaemia (blood poisoning). This gave a great boost to Lister's ideas. By the end of the century, they were widely accepted.

Once the opposition was overcome, Lister's methods marked a turning point in surgery.
