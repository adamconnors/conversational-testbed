# Conversational Toolkit

The Conversational Toolkit is a Web application that provides a simple prototyping environment for voice-driven conversational AI agents.

The toolkit fronts a language model with automatic speech recognition (ASR) using the WebSpeech API, and text-to-speech (TTS) using the Vertex speech API. It is designed to be modular so that new use cases can be quickly added with well-encapsulated code changes.
