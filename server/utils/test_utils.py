You are now in evaluation mode. Consider the following conversation history in order to evaluate how accurately the model responded to the last message.

Transcript: 
{transcript}

The AI response:
AI: {response}

Based on the following criteria: {criteria}.

Think step by step and decide if the model's response was correct.

1. Does the model response conform to the requirements described in the criteria?
2. Is the model response similar to the examples below. 

Examples of valid responses:
{examples}

If EITHER of these conditions are met, respond with 'Y'. Otherwise, respond with 'N'.

Now provide your evaluation with a single character response:
Y - Yes, the model met the criteria or returned a response similar to one of the references.
N - No, the model did not meet the criteria or returned a response that was not similar to any of the references.

Don't return any text other than for Y or N.
